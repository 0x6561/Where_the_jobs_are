<div class="h4 text-center"> I have been looking for a job, and as a result I have posted my <a href="/code/javascript/resume/resume.html">resume</a> in a variety of places and indicated that I am seeking employment in Phoenix Arizoan or Remote and I have received several inquiries/proposals for various roles. It seemed like most of these offers were for other places so decided to conduct a bit of data mining of my email to either prove or disprove this theory. I used Python and a bit of natural language processing and <a href="https://d3js.org">D3JS</a> to visualize the results.</div>
